# Flight Fare Prediction

In this article, we will be analyzing the flight fare dataset using essential exploratory data analysis techniques then will draw some predictions about the price of the flight based on some features such as what type of airline it is, what is the arrival time, what is the departure time, what is the duration of the flight, source, destination and more.


## Takeaways from the blog

1.EDA: Learn the complete process of EDA

2.Data analysis: Learn to withdraw some insights from the dataset both mathematically and visualize it.

3.Machine learning model: Learn to make a Machine learning model after the data preprocessing steps.

4.Comparing the models: We will be working on multiple models so that we could choose the best one for that we need to know the techniques of how to compare our model to choose the best one so we will be covering that also.

## Dataset

1.Airline: So this column will have all the types of airlines like Indigo, Jet Airways, Air India, and many more.

2.Date_of_Journey: This column will let us know about the date on which the passenger's journey will start.

3.Source: This column holds the name of the place from where the passenger's journey will start.
Destination: This column holds the name of the place to where passengers wanted to travel.

4.Route: Here we can know about that what is the route through which passengers have opted to travel from his/her source to their destination.

5.Arrival_Time: Arrival time is when the passenger will reach his/her destination.

6.Duration: Duration is the whole time period that a flight will take to complete its journey from source to destination.

7.Total_Stops: This will let us know in how many places flights will stop there for the flight in the whole journey.

8.Additional_Info: In this column, we will get information about food, kind of food, and other amenities.

9.Price: Price of the flight for a complete journey including all the expenses before onboarding.
